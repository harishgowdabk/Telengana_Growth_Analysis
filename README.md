# Telengana_Growth_Analysis


Objective: • Explore Stamp Registration, Transportation and Ts-Ipass Datasets. Understand their attributes, categories and time period. • Analyze trends and patterns within each department. • Identify growth opportunities and areas needing attention. • Find correlation among these departments and report the overall growth of the state through insights and relevant visuals such as shape maps.

The project was on the Telangana Growth in which we have to analyse the data and provide important and meaningful insights to the Telagana Government. Excited to showcase my Project-building skills in this real-world. Telangana is one of the fastest growing states in india and one of the states with an open data policy. They have published all their data online.
